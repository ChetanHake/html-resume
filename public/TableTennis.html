
<p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced indoor sport played between two or four players. The game is played on a flat rectangular table, usually 2.74 meters long, 1.525 meters wide, and 0.76 meters high, divided into two equal halves by a net. Players use small rackets (also called paddles or bats) to hit a lightweight ball (weighing about 2.7 grams) back and forth across the table.</p>

Here are the basics of the game:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Objective:</b> The goal is to score points by making the ball land on the opponent's side of the table in a way that they are unable to return it.</li>
    <li><b>Serving:</b> The game begins with a serve. The server must throw the ball upward and hit it so that it bounces once on their side and then on the opponentâ€™s side.</li>
    <li><b>Rallying:</b> After the serve, players continue to hit the ball back and forth, allowing it to bounce once on their side before returning it.</li>
    <li><b>Scoring:</b> A point is scored when the opponent fails to return the ball, misses the table, hits it into the net, or commits a fault. The game typically goes to 11 or 21 points, depending on the rules used, and a player must win by at least 2 points.</li>
    <li><b>Gameplay:</b> Matches are usually best-of-five or best-of-seven games.</li>
</ul>
