<ul>
    <li><b>Basic Idea:</b>  You start with a small village and a few villagers. Your goal is to collect resources like food, wood, gold, and stone to grow your civilization by constructing buildings, researching technologies, and creating a strong army.</li>
    <li><b>Ages:</b> You progress through different "ages" (e.g., Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc.), which unlock better buildings, units, and technologies. Each age gives you access to more powerful tools for building and fighting.</li>
    <li><b>Gameplay:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Building:</b> You construct houses, barracks, stables, castles, and other buildings that help you develop your civilization.</li>
            <li><b>Resource Gathering:</b> Villagers gather resources by farming, chopping wood, mining, or hunting. These resources are essential for everything you build and train.</li>
            <li><b>Training Armies:</b> You train soldiers, archers, cavalry, and siege weapons to defend your empire or attack others.</li>
            <li><b>Battles:</b> You engage in battles against enemy players or computer-controlled opponents. You need good strategyâ€”like where to place your army, when to attack, and how to protect your base.</li>
            <li><b>Winning:</b> You can win by defeating your opponents through military conquest (destroying their buildings and armies), achieving certain objectives, or being the last civilization standing.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

Age of Empires is a mix of strategy, resource management, and warfare. It's popular because it requires planning, quick decision-making, and thinking ahead about how to build a strong empire while balancing economy and military strength.
